/**
 * Spring Java configuration files are located in the config package and specified via annotations

 * setting up the context, specifying the sources to scan for container beans, setting up Spring
 * Security, etc. User configurable values are still contained in property files and hence reside
 * in the resources location rather than with in the java source tree.
